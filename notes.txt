Components :-
Any piece of code or function is a component.
Component is a piece of code that can be reusable
Function components are stateless so we can use State in Class based Component only.

Two types to create

Functions inside the class are methods so no need to write function before declaring it.

Exports two types :-
export {function}
import {function} from

export default function  -- If its only one function and we can call with
                            different name also
import function from

Return only returns one line and one element
For one line we wrap (in this)
For one element we wrap in <div> or we can use <React.Fragment> it will not create a container as div do

Props : 
Its an essential way to pass information from one component to other. And it is parent child 

Events :


States :
States are similar to Props but Props are immutable means cant be changed
